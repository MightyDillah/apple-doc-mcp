# Apple Doc MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless access to Apple's Developer Documentation directly within your AI coding assistant.

## ðŸ“‹ Changelog
- 1.5.0 (Major update!)
  - Introduced per-technology caching, mandatory framework selection, and the guided discovery/search flow.
  - Now it doesnt spam the doc server, all tech is cached after first call making every search super efficient!
  - Uses several search fallbacks to make sure it finds what youre looking for, and if it fails it'll do a regex to the entire technology and still give you suggestions!
  - It now asks you which doc is more relevant! and has very rudemntary fuzzy search but it works really well!
  - Simplified MCP in so many ways that I am just kicking myself!
  - Handlers now live in 'src/server/handlers/', so each tool is easy to read and evolve without touching the entrypoint.
  - This should have been version 1.0.0, there are still some kinks so please report them.

- 1.0.2 - Completely removed due to AI slop, sorry I merged without thoroughly going through this.
- 1.0.1 â€“ Initial release.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm build
```

```"Use apple mcp select swiftui search tabbar"
```

Configure your MCP client (example):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-doc-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/apple-doc-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Typical Workflow

1. Explore the catalogue:
   - `discover_technologies { "query": "swift" }`
   - `discover_technologies { "page": 2, "pageSize": 10 }`
2. Lock in a framework:
   - `choose_technology "SwiftUI"`
   - `current_technology`
3. Search within the active framework:
   - `search_symbols { "query": "tab view layout" }`
   - `search_symbols { "query": "toolbar", "maxResults": 5 }`
4. Open documentation:
   - `get_documentation { "path": "TabView" }`
   - `get_documentation { "path": "documentation/SwiftUI/TabViewStyle" }`

### Search Tips
- Start broad (e.g. `"tab"`, `"animation"`, `"gesture"`).
- Try synonyms (`"sheet"` vs `"modal"`, `"toolbar"` vs `"tabbar"`).
- Use multiple keywords (`"tab view layout"`) to narrow results.
- If nothing turns up, re-run `discover_technologies` with a different keyword or pick another framework.

## ðŸ§° Available Tools
- `discover_technologies` â€“ browse/filter frameworks before selecting one.
- `choose_technology` â€“ set the active framework; required before searching docs.
- `current_technology` â€“ show the current selection and quick next steps.
- `search_symbols` â€“ fuzzy keyword search within the active framework.
- `get_documentation` â€“ view symbol docs (relative names allowed).
